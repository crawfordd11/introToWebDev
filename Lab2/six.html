    <Blockquote>&ldquo;
        I heard the bells on Christmas day
        Their old familiar carols play,
        And wild and sweet the words repeat
        Of peace on earth, good will to men.
        <br>
        I thought how, as the day had come,
        The belfries of all Christendom
        Had rolled along th&#8217;unbroken song
        Of peace on earth, good will to men.
        <br>
        And in despair I bowed my head:
        &ldquo;There is no peace on earth,&rdquo; I said,
        &ldquo;For hate is strong and mocks the song
        Of peace on earth, good will to men.&rdquo;
        <br>
        Then pealed the bells more loud and deep:
        &ldquo;God is not dead, nor doth he sleep;
        The wrong shall fail, the right prevail,
        With peace on earth, good will to men.&rdquo;
        <br>
        Till, ringing, singing, on its way,
        The world revolved from night to day,
        A voice, a chime, a chant sublime,
        Of peace on earth, good will to men!&rdquo;
