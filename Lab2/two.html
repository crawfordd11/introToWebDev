<h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
<p>
    Here is a little about my favoirte hobby. I really enjoy playing boad games. I love playing all kinds.
    Chess, Checkers, Catan, Rumy, Candyland, Scrabble, Dune, Power Grid, Dominion, and any game you can think of.
    I am especially intrested in learning new games. I recently learned this new game called Baltimore and Ohio, where
    you act as a rail road barron in the 1800s.
    There is astock market phase, and then there are two build phases.
    In the stock market phase, you buy stock in one company, and you can sell stocks from as many companies as you would
    like.
    The business phase you run the company or companies that you have majority in. You buy trains, build tracks, and
    visit the cities in your network.
    When you visit a city for business, you get paied. If you choose to pay shareholders, the stock goes up. If you
    choose to keep the money in company coffers,
    you have more money to buy better trains
